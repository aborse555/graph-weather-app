For Microsoft 30 Days of Graph, I created a simple webpage that uses the Graph platform to retrieve your location and show you the current weather of your location.
This was the first time I had coded, so it was a very educational experience! I am glad for the experience and opportunity to gain new skills!
I used Visual Studio Code, Graph Explorer, and Node.js. 
For any issues, I used Microsoft Learn and GitHub to troubleshoot.
To use, download zip and write "npm start" in your terminal.
